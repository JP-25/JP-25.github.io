  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

    abstract = "In this paper, we present Howdy Y’all, a multi-modal task-oriented dialogue agent developed for the 2021-2022 Alexa Prize TaskBot competition. Our design principles guiding Howdy Y’all aim for high user satisfaction through friendly and trustworthy encounters, minimization of negative conversation edge cases, and wide coverage over many tasks. Hence, Howdy Y’all is built upon a rapid prototyping platform to enable fast experimentation and powered by four key innovations to enable this vision: (i) First, it combines a rules, phonetic matching, and a transformer-based approach for robust intent understanding. (ii) Second, to accurately elicit user preferences and guide users to the right task, Howdy Y’all is powered by a contrastive learning search framework over sentence embeddings and a conversational recommender for eliciting preferences. (iii) Third, to support a variety of user question types, it introduces a new data augmentation method for question generation and a self-supervised answer selection approach for improving question answering. (iv) Finally, to help motivate our users and keep them engaged, we design an emotional conversation tracker that provides empathetic responses to keep users engaged and a monitor of conversation quality.",
